# Digital Anubis — Stanford XR Hackathon Project
*A VR system for ethical, emotionally guided interaction with digital legacies.*

---

## 🌌 Overview
**Digital Anubis** is an immersive XR experience that allows users to revisit, reinterpret, and emotionally process curated digital legacies of loved ones who have passed away. The system brings together **VR storytelling**, **AI-mediated dialogue**, **memory curation**, and **rich multimodal interaction** to create a respectful, emotionally grounded space for remembrance.

Users begin with a **1-minute emotional cinematic intro**, setting the tone for grief, memory, and connection. They are then guided by **Digital Anubis**, a gentle mediating entity who helps them navigate the memories, contextualize emotions, and safely interact with an AI representation built from the deceased’s digital traces. Digital Anubis does *not* impersonate the deceased directly; instead, it **mediates**, filters, and reframes the information to protect the emotional wellbeing of the bereaved.

Inside the **Digital Memory Garden**, users can:

- View and interact with curated **photos**, **videos**, and **text-based legacies** placed spatially around the environment  
- Trigger **voice-based interactions** through a VR “Tap to Start Listening” mechanic  
- Hear responses through **AI-generated speech** delivered via WAV audio playback  
- Watch legacy videos through a custom **VR video player** activated with an in-world start button  
- Experience a mediated, emotionally safe conversation through real-time LLM responses  
- Receive guidance and emotional framing from Digital Anubis throughout the journey  

The system is also designed as a foundation for future **multimodal extensions**, including conceptual integration with **Afference neuro-haptic rings**—envisioned to replay physical activity signatures (e.g., typing vibrations extracted from legacy videos) to enhance memory storytelling through touch.

Built during the **Stanford XR Hackathon (2025)**, this prototype explores how ethical, curated, AI-augmented afterlife interactions can support healing, reflection, and the confrontation of presence/absence in a modern digital world.
